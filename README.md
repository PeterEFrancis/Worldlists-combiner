# Wordlist Combiner


## How to use

1. Clone or download repository
> `git clone https://github.com/francisp336/Worldlists.git`

2. Use `combine.py` to combine the text files in the various .wordlist folders in
the Wordlist folders.
> `cd path/to/Wordlists/Scripts`

> `python combine.py`

When the words in files of a .wordlist folder are added to `FULL.txt`, a `.imported` file is added to the .wordlist folder.


3. Optionally run `sort-remove.sh` to sort and remove the words in `FULL.txt` that is created in the root directory of the repository.
